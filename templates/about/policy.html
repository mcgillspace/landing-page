						The Space Policy and Industry Research Group, or â€œSPIRG," endeavors to understand national space policies and the international space industry from a comparative perspective so as to aid companies and law makers in entering this growing territory. Space affects every nation, not just those whom signed the 1967 United Nations Outer Space Treaty.
					</p>
					<p class="indent-para">
						 SPIRG is a dedicated team of people from the fields of International Relations, Economics, Law, and Geography ranging from passionate undergraduates to graduate students to faculty members. Increasingly, space is being populated by new national entities as well as commercial actors, all of which are straining the Cold War era legal framework that the orbit and deep space are governed by. Some of the principle beneficiaries of the contemporary space industry are developing countries and those on the frontline of climate change. Additionally, the renewal of tensions between nuclear powers has increased the risk of the militarization of Space. 
					 </p>
					 <p class="indent-para">
						 SPIRG aims to understand these phenomena so as to aid those groups, companies, and national agencies in devising appropriate policies that will engender the continued development of space for peaceful and sustainable purposes.

						SPIRG aims to understand the governmental and corporate actors who have shaped the space industrial ecosystem. In endeavoring to do so, we read policy and technology briefs, legislation, market information, and many other sources of news so that we can more fully appreciate the political constructs that have both enabled and hindered the progress of space development.
