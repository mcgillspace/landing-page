						The MSSG believes that one of the most adequate methods of learning engineering is by working on projects thereby learning the design process in a team. The CSDC group provides the opportunity for students to learn through designing and building. By competing in the CSDC, students gain experience in many engineering disciplines, they will learn how to work in a team and will gain various soft skills.
